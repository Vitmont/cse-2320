# Lab 3 - Binary Search Table Ranks

## Requirements
-   a.Write a C program to read the two ordered integerinput sequences and then a sequence ofranks(queries).  For each rank you should trace the binary search (one line per “probe”) and then indicate which element of which sequence has the desired rank.  The first line of the input file will give m, n, and pwhere mis the number of elements in the first sequence, nis the number of elements in the second sequence, and pis the number of ranks (queries) for which binary searches will be performed.  The integerinput sequence elements will be in the range 0 . . . 999,999, inclusive.  The ranks will be in the range 1 . . . m + n.
-   The output line for each Θ1()time probe should include the values of low, high, i, and j.  You may also include other debugging information, such as the result of the probe.
