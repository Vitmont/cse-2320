Algorithms Notes 2

Asymptotic Notation is used to describe the growth of functions

O(()) or upper bounds are used for particular Algorithms performance 
(Omega()) or lower bounds are used for indicating the inherent difficulty of the problem
    - if solving this problem, you need at least this ammount of resources
(Theta())   or asymptoically tight bound - used to express time for worst case instances of the algorithm
