# Lab 3 - Order Preserving Huffman Code

## Requirements
-   Use C to implement order-preservingHuffman coding -using thedynamic programming formulation describedin Notes  7.C.
-   The input is 1) a positive integer nand 2) a sequence of ndoubles giving the probabilitiesfor symbols in an ordered character set. To simplify output, the character set will be referenced numerically as 0 . . . n-1.
-   Your program should output 1) the optimal order-preserving Huffman code treeand 2) the bit code assigned to each symbol and the expected bits per symbols(âˆ‘ length*prob) based on the generated code tree and the input probabilities.
